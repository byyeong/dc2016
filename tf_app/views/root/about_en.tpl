                                            Running a startup is not easy, but launching a startup is even harder, especially for those who have little experience in entrepreneurship. That's why we have decided to help entrepreneurs in the very early stage. Aligned with our goal of fostering entrepreneurship, we are running seed money co-investment program with proven investors.

                                            Korean government is keen to boost venture industry under the banner of 'creative ecomomy'. Financial Services Commission launched a ground breaking fund of funds called Growth Ladder Fund in August. It is USD 1.8B worth of funds aimed for small venture companies to access equity capital market. It will be used to support startups in all stages of its life cycle form growth to exit.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Banks Foundation for Young Entrepreneurs recevied invitation to become a limited partner of the und since we are so successful in fulfilling our goal and mission: building a startup ecosystem and supporting startups. As one of the four limited partners of Growth Ladder Fund, we are spearheading the fund for early stage startups and young entrepreneurs. We have committed about USD 325M, which is about 20% of the whole amount that the limited partners plan to invest for next 3 years. We are very excited to become the only limited partner from the private sector and to have this opportunity to lead the startup funding sector in Korea aligned in close association with the government.

                                        <p> Weformed a fund of funds worth USD 45M to play catalytic role in fostering investment in industries where there is a lack of investors' interest, such a intellectual property, patent and cultural content. We believe diversity brings value to the society and startup ecosystem. While we keep our eyes on booming industries like mobile, game and ICT, we also would like to capture the potential in more intangible assets and businesses even though it requires longer-term investment.</p>
                                        <p> We have setup four kinds of fund of funds where each one of them is designed to support specific startup industry. We have carefully selected qualified venture capicals with proven track record in the specific areas we'd like to invest in. Thery will match our commitment, making it approximately USD 80M for the four fund of funds.</p>

This fund is designed to help startups survive through the death valley. It would have not been posible to put the fund together if it wasn't for the foundation's initiative. We hope this will serve as a role model for other intellectual property funds to come in the future.</p>
